# 6502-Assembly-NES-Game-Development
![Designed for Nintendo Entertainment System 6502 CPU][console-version]

Just messing around with programming a Nintendo Entertainment System / Famicom game from scratch in 6502 assembly.
Note that this is an unfinished, archived project of mine from 2019/2020.

## Source Code

The source code is located in the infile.asm and the mario.chr files.
The mario.chr is what is known as the character ROM and contains all graphical data to be used in the game.
The infile.asm is what is known as the program ROM, and contains everything else. It is written entirely in 6502 assembly language.

## Compiled ROM

The fully compiled software is infile.nes and can be run on either an emulator or real Nintendo hardware (both tested).

## Special Thanks

I would like to give special thanks to [nerdynights](https://taywee.github.io/NerdyNights/) for their extensive knowledge sharing on the subject.
Also a special thanks to Lance A. Leventhal for his great 1979 book "6502 Assembly Language Programming"!
